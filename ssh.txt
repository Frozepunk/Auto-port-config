#  Prerequisites:

Access to a user account with sudo privileges.
Access to a terminal window/command line (Ctrl-Alt-T).

# Step 1: Update the System Packages

Start by updating your repositories â€“ enter the following command in the terminal of window:

```sudo apt update```

# Step 2: Install SSHserver(Secure Shell Server) in by using this command :

```sudo apt install openssh-server```

# Step 3: Check Whether it is active or not by using the following command :

```sudo systemctl status ssh```

if it displays/exhibits inactive. Then,it  may be the problem of firewall.  

In some cases the Ubuntu firewall UFW(Uncomplicated Firewall) may block SSH. To ensure this doesn't happen, use the following commad :
		
```sudo ufw allow ssh```

In some cases, you'll need to also enable SSH on the remote device. This is a security precaution that can be tweaked using the following command:

```sudo systemctl enable ssh```

After all these command, use the following command to ensure it is active or not:

```sudo systemctl status ssh```
