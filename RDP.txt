Introduction:

NoVNC is a web-based VNC (Virtual Network Computing) client that allows you to access and control remote desktop environments through a web browser. 
This documentation provides a step-by-step guide to automate the setup of NoVNC Ubuntu, enabling you to access desktop environment from a browser.

Prerequisites:
Ubuntu installed.
Internet connectivity.

Step 1: Install Dependencies

To begin, we need to install some dependencies that are required for running NoVNC.

Open a terminal and execute the following commands:

```sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y novnc websockify```

Step 2: Launch NoVNC
Once the dependencies are installed, we can start the NoVNC service.

Execute the following command in the terminal:

```sudo systemctl start novnc```

Step 3 : Know in which display it is running.

```x11vnc -display :0 -autoport -localhost -nopw -bg -xkb -ncache -ncache_cr -quiet -forever```
 
Step 4 :Then, we get the NoVNC in running (this will open 8081/TCP).

 ``` /usr/share/novnc/utils/novnc_proxy --listen 8081 --vnc localhost:5900```

Step 5 : Acces the desktop by RDP application in windows or linux.
